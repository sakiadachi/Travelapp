## API
This application gets information from three APIs.
- [GeoNames API](https://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html) to get Latitude and Longitude of a city name submitted on the app.
- [weatherbit API](https://www.weatherbit.io/) to get weather forecast based on the data from GeoNames API and the date submitted on the app.
- [pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) to get a picture of a travel destination for an app.

## Webpack scripts
1. "npm install" to install the dependencies.
2. "npm start" to run server.
3. "npm run build-dev" to open localhost:8080 to see the live app.
4. "npm run build-prod" for production.
5. "npm test" for testing with JEST.
